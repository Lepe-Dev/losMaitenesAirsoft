# Team work 
## Important!!! : always do the “git pull origin main” to check whether anybody has made any changes.
## Never merge branches locally to the main branch and then push them to the remote repo when working collaboratively.

1. Create a new branch with the name of the component 
2. git add . 
3. git commit “message”
4. git push origin +nameOfBranch
This will upload the branch to the main one. Then, changes will be shown on github to do the merge if necessary.
Once the merging has been given the ok, you can delete the branch from github if needed.
Every time you build a new feature, do the git pull origin main in order to check for changes first.
